Just testing git pre-commit hooks with Husky.

== Description ==

Plugin files generated with @wordpress/create-block.
Added linting configured with @wordpress/eslint-plugin, stylelint-config-wordpress, and webdevstudios/php-coding-standards.
Used Husky to forbid non-passing commits on pre-commit hook.
Watched while the @wordpress/create-block failed linting and commits were prevented.
Fixed up linting errors, got commits to go through.

== Installation ==

Don't install this. I'm just testing tooling.
